# Refactoring Log 2 - Removing Redundant Structures

This document details the changes made during the second refactoring phase of the `gitcodes-mcp` project. It focuses on removing redundant type definitions to improve code clarity.

## Summary of Changes

1. Removed the redundant `GitRef` struct and replaced with direct `String` usage

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Replacing GitRef with String

The `GitRef` struct was essentially a wrapper around a `String` with minimal functionality, making it unnecessarily complex. It has been refactored to use `String` directly.

```diff
- // Simple type to represent a Git reference (branch, tag, etc.)
- #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
- pub struct GitRef {
-     pub name: String,
- }
- 
- impl GitRef {
-     pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
-         Self { name }
-     }
-     
-     // For convenience in formatting
-     pub fn as_str(&self) -> &str {
-         &self.name
-     }
- }
```

The `update_repository` method was updated to use `&str` directly instead of `&GitRef`:

```diff
- async fn update_repository(&self, _git_ref: &GitRef) -> Result<(), String> {
-     // This functionality is temporarily disabled during refactoring
-     // TODO: Reimplement with current gix API
-     Err("Repository updating is temporarily disabled during refactoring.".to_string())
- }
+ async fn update_repository(&self, _ref_name: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
+     // This functionality is temporarily disabled during refactoring
+     // TODO: Reimplement with current gix API
+     Err("Repository updating is temporarily disabled during refactoring.".to_string())
+ }
```

This change simplifies the codebase by removing an unnecessary abstraction. The `GitRef` struct didn't provide enough additional functionality to justify its existence as a separate type, and using a plain string for Git references is more straightforward and common in Rust projects.

## Current Status and Next Steps

The code is now more streamlined with the removal of the unnecessary `GitRef` wrapper type. The codebase continues to build successfully.

### Outstanding Tasks

1. Continue addressing other refactoring tasks identified in previous logs
2. Clean up the unused imports and variables (warnings are present in the build output)
3. Implement the stubbed-out functionality that was temporarily disabled during refactoring
